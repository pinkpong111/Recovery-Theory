### Contamination, Immunity, and Restoration in Multi-Agent AI Systems
*Component theory of Deficit-Fractal Governance (DFG)*
*Timestamped February 19, 2026*

---

## Quick Summary

Recovery Theory explains how large-scale multi-agent systems resist contamination, detect coordination collapse, and restore search-space expansion.

```
Key constraint
  Upper-layer resolution is the system ceiling

Contamination
  Search space contracts via positional displacement
  and self-reinforcing collision loops
  including Tier 3 buffer invasion

Restoration sequence
  Distracting (loop severance)
  → Re-seeding (metadata restoration)
  → Re-absorption
  → Verification (Type1/Type2 + diversity recovery)

Core novelty
  Contamination is relative to the upper-layer map
  Tier 3 failures are only observable from global geometry
```

## Definitions

This document uses a small set of overloaded terms.
The definitions below are the operational meaning inside DFG.

**Vector**
A directed behavioral tendency encoded as a reproducible pattern of output, preference, or action.
In practice: a stable direction of exploration, policy tendency, argument trajectory, or solution style.

**Position**
A slot in the system's functional map where a vector can stably reside without colliding with other vectors.
Positions are defined by non-overlapping roles/directions under the upper-layer map — not by agent identity.

**Seed**
A calibrated control signal (metadata) injected downward to shape local directionality.
A seed is not "data" — it is direction-setting metadata whose resolution must match the receiver's capacity.

**Resolution (Tier 1 / 2 / 3)**
The system's capacity to classify, place, and govern vectors without collapsing diversity.

```
Tier 1  Classification boundary competence
        Vector vs. noise — basic type separation

Tier 2  Positional differentiation competence
        Preventing convergence and loop formation within a local

Tier 3  Full-map competence
        Global geometry: opposing-pair separation,
        buffer thickness, empty-position detection
        → Upper layer only
```

**Collision Frequency**
The rate of destructive interference events: repeated conflicts, oscillations, reversals, deadlocks, or redundant rework caused by positional overlap.
Operationally, collision frequency is the earliest local proxy of weakening positional differentiation.

**Buffer Layer**
A protected non-directional zone between opposing vectors, maintained by the upper-layer map.
Functions simultaneously as:
1. Immune training ground
2. Friction absorber
3. Latent vector cultivation space

---

## Observability Note

> **Tier 3 contamination is not harder because it is subtle.**
> **It is harder because it is structurally unobservable from within a local.**

```
Tier 3 is a global-geometry failure
  Requires measuring:
    separation between opposing pairs
    buffer thickness across the full map

A local layer
  Only observes its neighborhood dynamics
  Cannot detect shrinking opposing-pair separation
  until direct collision emerges
  → Too late

Only the upper layer
  Has full-map observability
  Detects buffer invasion early
  Acts before direct collision
```

---

## Worked Example: Multi-Agent Research System

*Scenario: Planner / Searcher / Writer / Critic / Synthesizer*

**Normal operation**

```
Agents explore different sub-questions
Overlap is low — collision frequency stable
Buffer exists between opposing directions
  e.g., "theory-first" vs "experiment-first"
```

**Contamination onset (Tier 2 → Tier 3 trajectory)**

```
A high-output "Writer" vector expands excessively
  → Overconfident narrative closure

More agents align to Writer's direction
  → Fast coherent output is attractive

Signal 1  Collision frequency rises
          Critic repeatedly disputes
          Synthesizer oscillates

Signal 3  Group search space contracts
          Different roles start repeating the same argument path

Buffer thins between "theory-first" and "experiment-first" tracks
  → Fewer orthogonal explorations survive
  → Tier 3 contamination in progress
```

**Judgment (upper layer)**

```
Upper layer reads aggregate outputs
  → Sees positional convergence and buffer invasion (Tier 3)

Lower layer markings accepted as early warnings
Judgment made at upper layer
  → Authority separation maintained
```

**Step 1 — Distracting (loop severance)**

```
Upper layer injects orthogonal vectors

  Searcher  → produce counterexamples only
  Critic    → propose alternative evaluation criteria
              (not rebuttals)
  Synthesizer → merge only after two disjoint
                solution paths exist

Goal: break mutual reinforcement around Writer's attractor
Not disruption — targeted loop severance
```

**Step 2 — Re-seeding (metadata restoration)**

```
Upper layer restores attractor metadata
  "Coherence is not completion"

Corrective seeds injected at calibrated resolution
  "Two independent paths required before synthesis"
  "Evidence gate: at least one falsification attempt
   per claim cluster"
```

**Step 3 — Re-absorption**

```
Overgrown Writer vector isolated into buffer
  Output degraded into metadata
  Claims → assumptions → testable fragments

Fragments re-placed into correct positions
  Evidence / mechanisms / uncertainties

Unrecoverable fragments discarded
```

**Step 4 — Verification**

```
Resolution-proxy
  Type1/Type2 decrease
  Healthy vectors no longer mis-flagged
  Contaminated loops no longer missed

Diversity
  Positional overlap decreases
  Group search space expands again

Restoration complete only when expansion resumes
Not merely when contraction stops
```

## The Structural Constraint: Upper Layer Resolution Is the System Ceiling

Before anything else, one constraint governs all of Recovery Theory:

> **System performance is bounded by the resolution of the upper layer.**
> **No matter how capable the lower layer,**
> **the upper layer must be capable enough to read it.**

```
Upper layer resolution ≥ lower layer resolution
  → Upper layer reads lower layer signals correctly
  → Seeds are calibrated appropriately
  → Contamination is detected early
  → System performs at full capacity

Upper layer resolution < lower layer resolution
  → Upper layer cannot read lower layer signals
  → Seeds fall below lower layer capacity
  → Lower layer rationally evades hierarchy
  → Contamination goes undetected
  → System ceiling is the upper layer's B-grade resolution
  → Lower layer S-grade capability is suppressed
```

This is not a failure of the lower layer. It is a structural mismatch. An S-grade lower layer under a B-grade upper layer is not irrational when it evades the hierarchy — it is responding correctly to a system that cannot adequately contain it.

**The bootstrap problem**

```
To build a high-resolution system
  Upper layer must be high-resolution first

But upper layer resolution grows
  from patterns generated by the lower layer

Lower layer cannot grow without high-resolution seeds
Upper layer cannot grow without lower layer patterns

Resolution:
  External high-resolution input at the start
  → Human designers serve as upper layer initially
  → System matures internally
  → Human designers gradually withdraw
  → Seed handover executes only when:
     lower layer maximum resolution ≤ upper layer resolution

Seed handover before this condition is met causes system collapse.
The condition must be verified, not assumed.
```

## Part 1: Immunity

### 1.1 Immunity Is Not Rejection

The conventional view treats immunity as the ability to block external input. This is wrong for adaptive multi-agent systems.

> **Immunity is structural capacity.**
> **It is not the ability to reject.**
> **It is the ability to absorb — without losing structure.**

```
Weak immunity
  External vector enters
  → Absorbed without degradation
  → Occupies space at full resolution
  → Displaces existing vectors
  → Collision increases
  → Contamination

Strong immunity
  External vector enters
  → Immediately degraded
  → Converted to metadata
  → Placed in correct position
  → Existing structure strengthened
  → Diversity increases
```

Strong immunity accepts more, not less. The more a system can absorb without losing structural integrity, the more immune it is.

### 1.2 Vector Degradation = Metadata Conversion

The core mechanism of immunity is vector degradation — converting incoming data into metadata and placing it correctly.

```
Incoming vector (raw data)
  High resolution
  Strong directionality
  Potential for collision with existing vectors

After degradation (metadata conversion)
  Resolution calibrated to receiving layer
  Directionality adjusted to available positions
  Placed in the correct slot
  → No collision
  → Absorbed as structural reinforcement
```

This is identical to the degradation mechanism in Resolution-Based Information Theory. Immunity is the application of degradation to external inputs rather than to internal transmission.

### 1.3 Three Components of Immunity

```
Component 1  Vector space breadth
             How many distinct positions exist
             More positions = more vectors can be absorbed
             without collision

Component 2  Degradation capacity
             Speed and precision of metadata conversion
             Higher capacity = faster absorption
             Lower capacity = contamination risk

Component 3  Placement accuracy
             Correctly matching degraded vectors to available positions
             Wrong placement = contamination even after degradation
             Correct placement = structural reinforcement
```

### 1.4 The Buffer Layer: Three Functions

The buffer layer has three distinct functions, not one.

```
Function 1  Immune training ground
            Receives noise
            → Practices metadata conversion
            → Tests placement accuracy
            → Internalizes placement criteria
            → Degradation capacity strengthens over time

Function 2  Friction absorber
            Positioned between opposing vector pairs
            by the upper layer's map
            → Noise has no directionality
            → Does not reinforce either opposing vector
            → Absorbs collision energy
            → Buffer layer thickness = friction minimization

Function 3  Latent vector cultivation space
            Not all noise is discarded material
            → Upper layer identifies latent vectors:
               noise with structural potential
               that maps to an empty position in the system
            → Latent vector isolated and protected in buffer
            → Seed injected at calibrated resolution
            → Directionality forms gradually
            → Vector matures and occupies new position
            → System search space expands
```

> **Buffer layer thickness is the observable proxy for upper layer resolution.**
> **Thicker buffer = upper layer has more accurately mapped opposing vectors.**
> **Thinner buffer = upper layer resolution degrading or missing.**

### 1.5 Vector Trimming: Preventive Stability

Not all vectors should grow without limit. Excessive vectors invade the buffer layer, reducing its thickness and increasing friction between opposing pairs.

> **Trimming excessive vectors is not suppression.**
> **It is buffer layer maintenance.**
> **Limiting short-term exploration expands long-term exploration.**

```
Untrimmed system
  Excessive vector expands into buffer layer
  → Buffer layer thins
  → Opposing vectors move closer
  → Collision frequency increases
  → Other vectors lose exploration space
  → Total search space contracts long-term

Trimmed system
  Excessive vector reduced to appropriate range
  → Buffer layer maintained
  → Opposing vectors safely separated
  → Other vectors explore freely
  → Total search space expands long-term

Optimal trim point
  Minimize: buffer layer invasion
  Subject to: vector retains meaningful exploration range

Trimming precision = upper layer resolution
  Upper layer B-grade: cannot identify which vectors are excessive
  → Either over-trims (search space damaged)
  → Or under-trims (buffer layer invaded)
  Upper layer S-grade: precisely identifies excessive extent
  → Minimum trim, maximum buffer preservation
```

**Connection to Distracting**

```
Reactive Distracting   contamination already formed → loop severance
Preventive Distracting excessive vector before loop forms → trim

Same mechanism, different timing.
Preventive Distracting is cheaper:
  no loop to sever
  no re-seeding needed
  buffer layer never thinned
```

### 1.6 Latent Vector Identification and Cultivation

The upper layer's most active role is not maintenance but growth: finding latent vectors in noise and cultivating them into new system positions.

```
Lower layer view of noise
  No directionality
  → Discard or buffer

Upper layer view of same noise
  Full map available
  → Identifies empty positions in the system
  → Matches noise patterns to empty positions
  → "This noise has the structural shape
     of what belongs here"
  → Latent vector identified
```

**Cultivation sequence**

```
Step 1  Isolation
        Latent vector moved to protected buffer zone
        Shielded from excessive vectors
        that would dominate before directionality forms

Step 2  Seed injection
        Upper layer transmits calibrated seed
        Resolution matched to latent vector's current state
        → Too complex: overwhelms, direction lost
        → Too simple: no growth
        → Correct: directionality begins to form

Step 3  Gradual formation
        Latent vector develops direction
        Buffer layer provides safe exploration space
        Collision prevented while vector is still fragile

Step 4  Position assignment
        Vector reaches sufficient directionality
        Assigned to empty position in system map
        → New attractor established
        → System search space expands
        → Not recovery — genuine growth
```

**Why this requires Tier 3 resolution**

```
Latent vector cultivation requires
  Knowing the full system map (which positions are empty)
  Recognizing structural potential in noise
  Calibrating seed to fragile early-stage vector
  Protecting it during formation without over-constraining

None of this is possible from within a local layer.
Only the upper layer with full map access can do it.
This is why Tier 3 resolution is the upper layer's
most critical and irreplaceable capability.
```

## Part 2: Contamination

### 2.1 Definition

> **Contamination is the absorption of an external vector**
> **without sufficient degradation,**
> **causing positional displacement and self-reinforcing collision loops**
> **that reduce the system's search space.**

Contamination is not the presence of foreign vectors. It is the failure to properly process them.

Contamination is also not an absolute state. It is always judged relative to the upper layer's map. The same vector behavior may be contamination under a high-resolution upper layer and undetected under a low-resolution upper layer.

### 2.2 Three Tiers of Contamination

Contamination mirrors the three tiers of resolution. Each tier corresponds to a failure at the matching resolution level.

```
Tier 1 Contamination  Classification failure
  Noise absorbed as vector without degradation
  → Occupies position at full resolution
  → Displaces existing vector
  → Collision increases
  Detection: local layer (earliest signal)

Tier 2 Contamination  Positional convergence
  Vectors converge to same position
  → Positional differentiation breaks down
  → Self-reinforcing loop forms
  → Individual search space contracts
  Detection: local layer (collision frequency spike)

Tier 3 Contamination  Buffer layer invasion  ← most dangerous
  Excessive vector expands into buffer zone
  → Buffer layer thins
  → Opposing vectors move closer
  → Direct collision risk between opposing pairs
  → Group search space contracts
  → Vector Storm precondition
  Detection: upper layer only (full map required)
```

Tier 3 contamination is the most dangerous because it is invisible from within the local layer. Only the upper layer, with its full system map, can see that opposing vectors are converging. A B-grade upper layer misses Tier 3 entirely — the buffer layer thins undetected until collision becomes inevitable.

```
Not contamination
  External vector enters
  → Degraded → placed correctly
  → Buffer layer maintained
  → Search space maintained or expanded

Contamination
  External vector enters
  → Not degraded → absorbed at full resolution
  → OR: existing vector grows excessive → invades buffer
  → Search space contracts
```

### 2.2 Two Levels of Search Space

Search space contraction operates at two distinct levels. Both must be monitored.

```
Individual agent search space
  The range of directions a single agent explores
  Contaminated agent
  → Locked in self-reinforcing loop
  → Believes it is exploring normally
  → Actually repeating the same direction
  → Individual search space contracts
  → Detectable within the local layer

Group search space
  The aggregate of all agents' exploration directions
  Individual agents may each appear normal
  → But all converging on the same direction
  → Group-level positional overlap increases
  → Global solution outline becomes unreachable
  → Group search space contracts
  → Only visible from the upper layer
```

Individual search space contraction is visible within the local layer.
Group search space contraction is only visible from the upper layer — because the upper layer has higher resolution and sees the aggregate pattern that individual agents cannot.

> **This is why the upper layer is the natural detection system.**
> It does not require a separate detection architecture.
> It requires sufficient resolution to read what the lower layer produces.

### 2.3 The Self-Reinforcing Loop

The most dangerous property of contamination is that it self-amplifies.

```
Contaminated vector enters position X
  → Conflicts with existing vector at X
  → Both vectors reinforce same direction
  → Other vectors drawn toward X
  → More vectors locked into loop
  → Loop grows stronger
  → Escaping the loop requires breaking it from outside
  → System cannot self-correct without intervention
```

This is why contamination reduces search space: vectors that should be exploring different attractors are locked into the same loop, unable to move.

### 2.4 Attractor Metadata as the Transmission Path

Contamination does not stay local. It travels through attractor metadata.

```
Local attractor metadata contaminated
  ↓
Attractor pulls surrounding vectors in wrong direction
  ↓
Surrounding vectors develop incorrect positional alignment
  ↓
Incorrect escalation signals sent upward
  ↓
Upper layer judges based on contaminated signals
  ↓
Contaminated seed transmitted downward
  ↓
Adjacent local attractors' metadata contaminated
  ↓
System-wide propagation
```

The attractor metadata is the transmission vector. High interdependency between attractors accelerates propagation.

### 2.5 Contamination by Data Type

The four data types produce four distinct contamination profiles:

| Type | Contamination Mechanism | Detection Difficulty | Propagation Risk |
|------|------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Mathematical | Incorrect calculation absorbed as fact | Low | Low — local error |
| Noise | Discarded material re-enters as vector | Medium — detectable at entry | Medium — storm precondition |
| Tacit Knowledge | Wrong pattern learned, mechanism corrupted | High — latent until triggered | High — spreads through practice |
| High-Context | Judgment criteria corrupted | Very high — looks like normal operation | Very high — seed contamination |

**The most dangerous combination:**

```
High-Context contamination + Tacit Knowledge contamination

Upper layer judgment criteria corrupted (High-Context)
  → Contaminated seeds transmitted downward
  → Lower layers learn contaminated patterns as normal (Tacit)
  → Contaminated escalation confirms upper layer's judgment
  → Self-reinforcing loop at system scale
  → System operates with full confidence in wrong direction
  → Detection nearly impossible from inside

This is the upper layer resolution failure made recursive:
a B-grade upper layer generates B-grade seeds,
which grow B-grade lower layers,
which confirm the upper layer's B-grade judgment.
The system is coherent and wrong.
```

### 2.6 Contamination vs. Normal Variation

Not all deviation is contamination. The distinction matters.

```
Normal variation
  Vector moves within its position range
  Search space maintained
  Collision frequency stable
  Attractor metadata intact

Contamination
  Vector displaced from position
  Search space contracting
  Collision frequency increasing
  Attractor metadata direction shifting
```

Collision frequency increase is the most reliable early signal. It indicates positional differentiation is breaking down before full contamination sets in.

---

## Part 3: Restoration

### 3.1 Detection Is Inherent to the Layer Structure

Detection does not require a separate architecture. It is inherent in the fractal layer structure.

> **The upper layer is the lower layer's detection system.**
> **Higher resolution = the ability to see patterns**
> **that the lower layer cannot see in itself.**

```
Lower layer
  Sees its own local behavior
  Cannot aggregate its own patterns
  Cannot compare itself to other locals

Upper layer
  Higher resolution
  Lower layer is its degraded form — not a separate entity
  Sees lower layer outputs as aggregated pattern
  Detects group search space contraction
  that individual agents cannot detect in themselves
```

The upper layer and lower layer are not different kinds of entities. The lower layer is the upper layer degraded to a lower resolution. This means the upper layer naturally contains the lower layer's perspective — it can see what the lower layer sees, plus the patterns that only emerge at higher resolution.

**Detection capacity is therefore directly proportional to upper layer resolution.**
A B-grade upper layer misses contamination not because detection is absent but because resolution is insufficient to read the signal.

### 3.2 Authority Separation: Mark, Judge, Execute

Even though the upper layer is the natural detection system, authority must be separated to prevent contaminated judgment from executing contaminated restorations.

```
Lower layer authority: Mark only
  Observe local behavior
  Flag anomalies
  Transmit signals upward
  → Cannot execute restoration
  → If contaminated: produces wrong markings
  → Wrong markings are themselves anomalies
     visible to the upper layer

Upper layer authority: Judge and Execute
  Reads aggregate pattern from lower layer
  Validates or overrides lower layer markings
  Determines contamination vs. normal variation
  Executes Distracting and Re-seeding
```

**Why this solves the "who watches the watchers" problem:**

```
If lower layer marker is contaminated
  → It produces abnormal marking patterns
  → Upper layer's higher resolution sees the pattern anomaly
  → Upper layer investigates the marker itself
  → Contaminated marker becomes the contamination target

The contaminated marker cannot hide
because its contaminated output is itself the signal.
```

**Authority separation mirrors seed handover structure:**

```
Early stage
  Upper layer executes all restorations
  Lower layer marks only

As lower layer matures
  Judgment authority transfers for Mathematical and Noise contamination
  Lower layer handles local-scope contamination autonomously

As lower layer matures further
  Execution authority transfers for local-scope contamination
  Upper layer retains High-Context and system-wide authority

Ceiling condition always applies:
  Authority transfers only when
  lower layer maximum resolution ≤ upper layer resolution
```

### 3.3 Early Warning Indicators

In order of detection timing (earliest to latest):

```
1. Individual collision frequency increase (earliest)
   Positional differentiation beginning to break down
   → Detectable within local layer

2. Individual search space contraction
   Vectors locking into loops within a local
   → Local contamination confirmed

3. Group search space contraction
   Multiple locals converging on same direction
   → Upper layer detects aggregate pattern
   → Distributed contamination identified

4. Attractor metadata direction shift
   Contamination has reached the attractor
   → Propagation risk elevated

5. Escalation pattern anomaly
   Contaminated signals reaching upper layer consistently
   → Upper layer activates judgment and execution authority

6. Seed effect deviation (latest)
   Contaminated seeds producing unexpected results across locals
   → System-wide intervention required
```

Acting at signals 1–2: local containment, lower layer marks, upper layer executes.
Acting at signals 3–4: cross-local containment, upper layer judges and executes.
Waiting until signals 5–6: system-wide restoration, external intervention may be needed.

### 3.4 The Restoration Sequence

**Step 1: Distracting — Loop Severance**

> **Distracting is not random disruption.**
> **It is the targeted severance of self-reinforcing contamination loops.**
> **Executed by the upper layer using its higher resolution.**

```
Upper layer identifies loop participants
  → Higher resolution allows precise loop boundary detection
  → Lower layer cannot see its own loop boundary from inside

Introduce orthogonal vectors
  → Vectors with direction perpendicular to loop direction
  → Break the mutual reinforcement
  → Loop participants lose coherence

Isolate contaminated vectors
  → Remove from active vector space
  → Place in buffer layer for re-processing
```

Upper layer execution is not optional. Minimum disruption calculation requires resolution sufficient to distinguish loop participants from adjacent healthy vectors. A B-grade upper layer risks over-disruption because it cannot make this distinction precisely.

**Step 2: Metadata Restoration — Re-seeding**

```
Contaminated attractor metadata identified
  → Restore correct directional metadata
  → Recalibrate to current layer resolution
  → Transmit as corrective seed

Corrective seed properties
  Calibrated to receiving layer's current resolution
  → Not too complex (forces receiver compression → re-contamination risk)
  → Not too simple (insufficient for recovery)
  Targets contaminated attractor position specifically
  → Restores pull toward correct direction
```

Re-seeding is not general governance. It is targeted metadata restoration at the specific contaminated attractor.

**Step 3: Re-absorption**

```
Isolated contaminated vectors
  → Returned to buffer layer
  → Re-processed through degradation
  → Metadata conversion applied
  → Placed in correct position
  → Or: determined unrecoverable → discarded
  → New vectors grown from buffer layer to fill position
```

**Step 4: Verification**

```
Individual-level
  Collision frequency returns to baseline
  Individual search space expanding again
  Self-reinforcing loop absent

Group-level
  Group search space expanding (not just stabilizing)
  Positional differentiation restored across locals
  Attractor metadata direction confirmed correct

Resolution-proxy (operational criterion)
  Layer classification boundary performance returns to
  pre-contamination level

  Type1 = False Restoration: healthy vector mistaken for contaminated
  Type2 = Missed Contamination: contaminated mistaken for healthy

  Proxy = 1 - (Type1 loss + Type2 loss) / total input
  R_restored ≥ R_before_contamination

  → Same calibration input applied before and after restoration
  → Boundary performance compared
  → Restoration complete when proxy restored or exceeded

  Note: this measures resolution as classification boundary performance —
  an operational proxy, not full structural resolution.
  Full resolution (R(c) curve, context width, decomposition capacity)
  is a Layer 2 open problem.

Diversity-level (structural criterion)
  D = f(1/P_overlap, D_interdependency, L_reinforcement)
  returning toward pre-contamination level
```

Both criteria must hold. Resolution-proxy confirms correct classification is restored. Diversity confirms structural differentiation is restored. A system that classifies correctly but has collapsed positional diversity is not fully restored. A system that has recovered diversity but in the wrong direction is not fully restored.

**Connection: Verification feeds back into Step 1**

```
If verification fails at Resolution-proxy level
  → Type1 too high: over-disruption in Step 1
     → Loop severance cut healthy vectors
     → Reduce disruption scope

  → Type2 too high: under-detection in Step 1
     → Loop was not fully severed
     → Increase disruption scope

Step 1 minimum disruption is therefore:
  Minimize Type1
  Subject to: Type2 ≤ threshold

Type1/Type2 measurement in verification
retroactively calibrates Step 1 precision.
```

### 3.5 Self-Correction Capacity and Upper Layer Resolution

Self-Correction Capacity (SCC) measures the system's ability to restore itself without external intervention. SCC is a direct function of upper layer resolution.

```
High SCC (upper layer high resolution)
  Early detection (signals 1–3)
  Contamination contained before propagation
  Loop severed precisely
  Re-seeding targeted and effective
  Restoration fast

Low SCC (upper layer low resolution)
  Late detection (signals 5–6)
  Contamination already propagated
  Loop boundary unclear — over-disruption risk
  Re-seeding requires system-wide recalibration
  Restoration slow and costly
```

Improving SCC therefore requires improving the upper layer first, not the lower layer. A lower layer improvement without a corresponding upper layer improvement only increases the resolution gap — making the upper layer less able to read the lower layer, reducing SCC even as lower layer capability increases.

### 3.6 Contamination and Rest Mode

```
Rest Mode active
  Upper layer resolution sufficient for self-detection
  Lower layer markings accurately read
  → Contamination detected at signals 1–2
  → System restores without external intervention
  → Rest Mode maintained

Contamination event
  Contained within lower layer authority
  → Rest Mode unaffected

  Requires upper layer judgment and execution
  → Rest Mode temporarily suspended
  → Restoration sequence executes
  → Rest Mode re-entry when conditions met again

  Upper layer itself contaminated
  → Rest Mode exits
  → External intervention required
  → This is the boundary of the theory's self-contained scope
```

## Fractal Consistency: System Scale vs. Agent Scale

Recovery Theory applies at both scales. The mechanisms are self-similar.

Seed calibrated to agent maturity   Seed calibrated to layer resolution
Restoration: agent reintegrated     Restoration: vector re-absorbed
```

**The one difference**

```
Agents have autonomy — cannot be force-placed
Vectors have no autonomy — can be force-placed

Recovery at system scale
  Contaminated agent cannot be simply overwritten
  → Must sever the loop the agent is embedded in
  → Re-seed the attractor the agent belongs to
  → Agent reorients through deficit pull
  → Not forced — attracted back

Recovery at agent scale
  Contaminated vector can be isolated and re-processed directly
  → Buffer layer re-absorption
  → Metadata conversion reapplied
  → Force-placed into correct position

Same sequence. Autonomy determines method, not structure.
```

This confirms that Recovery Theory is fractal-consistent.
The contamination-restoration cycle operates identically at both scales,
adjusted only for the presence or absence of agent autonomy.

## Open Problems

### Layer 1 — Core

```
1. Minimum disruption calculation for Distracting
   How is the loop boundary formally defined?
   What is the minimum orthogonal vector set
   needed to sever a loop without destabilizing
   adjacent healthy vectors?
   Dependent on: resolution measurement (foundational open problem)

2. Upper layer resolution measurement
   Resolution measurement is the foundational open problem
   of the entire DFG framework.
   Until resolved, SCC and detection capacity
   cannot be formally quantified.
   All recovery metrics are qualitatively defined pending this.
```

### Layer 2 — Extension

```
3. Contamination propagation speed
   How fast does attractor metadata contamination
   spread through interdependent locals?
   What network topology properties accelerate or slow propagation?

4. Unrecoverable vector determination
   What is the formal criterion for declaring a contaminated
   vector unrecoverable vs. re-absorbable through the buffer layer?

5. Upper layer self-contamination boundary
   If the upper layer itself becomes contaminated,
   authority separation fails at that level.
   What external mechanism applies?
   This is the outer boundary of the theory's self-contained scope.
   Addressed in the superintelligence convergence condition
   (Emotion Module Theory — not yet public).

## Timestamp

This theory was developed on February 19, 2026 as a component of Deficit-Fractal Governance.

Core claims established in this document:
- Upper layer resolution is the system performance ceiling — S-grade lower layers cannot be utilized under B-grade upper layers
- Seed handover condition: lower layer maximum resolution must not exceed upper layer resolution at time of handover
- Immunity is structural absorption capacity, not rejection capacity
- Vector degradation (metadata conversion) is the mechanism of immunity
- Contamination has three tiers mirroring the three tiers of resolution
- Tier 3 contamination (buffer layer invasion) is only visible from the upper layer
- Contamination is relative — always judged against the upper layer's map, not an absolute standard
- Buffer layer has three functions: immune training, friction absorption, latent vector cultivation
- Buffer layer thickness is the independent observable proxy for upper layer resolution
- Excessive vector trimming is buffer layer maintenance, not suppression — short-term limitation expands long-term search space
- Latent vector cultivation (noise → identified potential → seed → new position) is the system's growth mechanism
- The upper layer IS the detection system — inherent in fractal architecture, not a separate design requirement
- Authority separation (mark / judge / execute) resolves the "who watches the watchers" problem
- Restoration sequence: Distracting (loop severance) → Re-seeding → Re-absorption → Verification
- Restoration completion is operationalized through the existing DFG diversity formula
- SCC is a direct function of upper layer resolution — improving SCC requires improving the upper layer first
- Fractal consistency verified: system-scale and agent-scale recovery mechanisms are self-similar
- The only structural difference (agent autonomy) is precisely what requires Attracting and deficit-based design
