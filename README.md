## What This Theory Addresses

The core DFG framework defines how stable systems are built.
This theory defines what happens when they break — and how they recover.

> **A system that can only be built but not restored is fragile.**
> **A system that can detect, contain, and recover from contamination is resilient.**

Recovery Theory has three parts:

```
Part 1  Immunity
        What makes a system resistant to contamination

Part 2  Contamination
        What contamination is, how it enters, how it spreads

Part 3  Restoration
        How contamination is detected, contained, and reversed
```

---

## The Structural Constraint: Upper Layer Resolution Is the System Ceiling

Before anything else, one constraint governs all of Recovery Theory:

> **System performance is bounded by the resolution of the upper layer.**
> **No matter how capable the lower layer,**
> **the upper layer must be capable enough to read it.**

```
Upper layer resolution ≥ lower layer resolution
  → Upper layer reads lower layer signals correctly
  → Seeds are calibrated appropriately
  → Contamination is detected early
  → System performs at full capacity

Upper layer resolution < lower layer resolution
  → Upper layer cannot read lower layer signals
  → Seeds fall below lower layer capacity
  → Lower layer rationally evades hierarchy
  → Contamination goes undetected
  → System ceiling is the upper layer's B-grade resolution
  → Lower layer S-grade capability is suppressed
```

This is not a failure of the lower layer. It is a structural mismatch. An S-grade lower layer under a B-grade upper layer is not irrational when it evades the hierarchy — it is responding correctly to a system that cannot adequately contain it.

**The bootstrap problem**

```
To build a high-resolution system
  Upper layer must be high-resolution first

But upper layer resolution grows
  from patterns generated by the lower layer

Lower layer cannot grow without high-resolution seeds
Upper layer cannot grow without lower layer patterns

Resolution:
  External high-resolution input at the start
  → Human designers serve as upper layer initially
  → System matures internally
  → Human designers gradually withdraw
  → Seed handover executes only when:
     lower layer maximum resolution ≤ upper layer resolution

Seed handover before this condition is met causes system collapse.
The condition must be verified, not assumed.
```

## Part 1: Immunity

### 1.1 Immunity Is Not Rejection

The conventional view treats immunity as the ability to block external input. This is wrong for adaptive multi-agent systems.

> **Immunity is structural capacity.**
> **It is not the ability to reject.**
> **It is the ability to absorb — without losing structure.**

```
Weak immunity
  External vector enters
  → Absorbed without degradation
  → Occupies space at full resolution
  → Displaces existing vectors
  → Collision increases
  → Contamination

Strong immunity
  External vector enters
  → Immediately degraded
  → Converted to metadata
  → Placed in correct position
  → Existing structure strengthened
  → Diversity increases
```

Strong immunity accepts more, not less. The more a system can absorb without losing structural integrity, the more immune it is.

### 1.2 Vector Degradation = Metadata Conversion

The core mechanism of immunity is vector degradation — converting incoming data into metadata and placing it correctly.

```
Incoming vector (raw data)
  High resolution
  Strong directionality
  Potential for collision with existing vectors

After degradation (metadata conversion)
  Resolution calibrated to receiving layer
  Directionality adjusted to available positions
  Placed in the correct slot
  → No collision
  → Absorbed as structural reinforcement
```

This is identical to the degradation mechanism in Resolution-Based Information Theory. Immunity is the application of degradation to external inputs rather than to internal transmission.

### 1.3 Three Components of Immunity

```
Component 1  Vector space breadth
             How many distinct positions exist
             More positions = more vectors can be absorbed
             without collision

Component 2  Degradation capacity
             Speed and precision of metadata conversion
             Higher capacity = faster absorption
             Lower capacity = contamination risk

Component 3  Placement accuracy
             Correctly matching degraded vectors to available positions
             Wrong placement = contamination even after degradation
             Correct placement = structural reinforcement
```

### 1.4 The Buffer Layer as Immune Training Ground

The buffer layer does not only grow vectors from noise. It trains degradation capacity.

```
Buffer layer function (immune training)
  Receives noise
  → Practices metadata conversion
  → Tests placement accuracy
  → Internalizes placement criteria

As buffer layer matures
  Degradation speed increases
  Placement accuracy increases
  → Immunity strengthens
  → System can absorb more diverse external vectors
  → Search space expands
```

---

## Part 2: Contamination

### 2.1 Definition

> **Contamination is the absorption of an external vector**
> **without sufficient degradation,**
> **causing positional displacement and self-reinforcing collision loops**
> **that reduce the system's search space.**

Contamination is not the presence of foreign vectors. It is the failure to properly process them.

```
Not contamination
  External vector enters
  → Degraded → placed correctly
  → Search space maintained or expanded

Contamination
  External vector enters
  → Not degraded → absorbed at full resolution
  → Collides with existing vectors
  → Self-reinforcing loop forms
  → Search space contracts
```

### 2.2 Two Levels of Search Space

Search space contraction operates at two distinct levels. Both must be monitored.

```
Individual agent search space
  The range of directions a single agent explores
  Contaminated agent
  → Locked in self-reinforcing loop
  → Believes it is exploring normally
  → Actually repeating the same direction
  → Individual search space contracts
  → Detectable within the local layer

Group search space
  The aggregate of all agents' exploration directions
  Individual agents may each appear normal
  → But all converging on the same direction
  → Group-level positional overlap increases
  → Global solution outline becomes unreachable
  → Group search space contracts
  → Only visible from the upper layer
```

Individual search space contraction is visible within the local layer.
Group search space contraction is only visible from the upper layer — because the upper layer has higher resolution and sees the aggregate pattern that individual agents cannot.

> **This is why the upper layer is the natural detection system.**
> It does not require a separate detection architecture.
> It requires sufficient resolution to read what the lower layer produces.

### 2.3 The Self-Reinforcing Loop

The most dangerous property of contamination is that it self-amplifies.

```
Contaminated vector enters position X
  → Conflicts with existing vector at X
  → Both vectors reinforce same direction
  → Other vectors drawn toward X
  → More vectors locked into loop
  → Loop grows stronger
  → Escaping the loop requires breaking it from outside
  → System cannot self-correct without intervention
```

This is why contamination reduces search space: vectors that should be exploring different attractors are locked into the same loop, unable to move.

### 2.4 Attractor Metadata as the Transmission Path

Contamination does not stay local. It travels through attractor metadata.

```
Local attractor metadata contaminated
  ↓
Attractor pulls surrounding vectors in wrong direction
  ↓
Surrounding vectors develop incorrect positional alignment
  ↓
Incorrect escalation signals sent upward
  ↓
Upper layer judges based on contaminated signals
  ↓
Contaminated seed transmitted downward
  ↓
Adjacent local attractors' metadata contaminated
  ↓
System-wide propagation
```

The attractor metadata is the transmission vector. High interdependency between attractors accelerates propagation.

### 2.5 Contamination by Data Type

The four data types produce four distinct contamination profiles:

| Type | Contamination Mechanism | Detection Difficulty | Propagation Risk |
|------|------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Mathematical | Incorrect calculation absorbed as fact | Low | Low — local error |
| Noise | Discarded material re-enters as vector | Medium — detectable at entry | Medium — storm precondition |
| Tacit Knowledge | Wrong pattern learned, mechanism corrupted | High — latent until triggered | High — spreads through practice |
| High-Context | Judgment criteria corrupted | Very high — looks like normal operation | Very high — seed contamination |

**The most dangerous combination:**

```
High-Context contamination + Tacit Knowledge contamination

Upper layer judgment criteria corrupted (High-Context)
  → Contaminated seeds transmitted downward
  → Lower layers learn contaminated patterns as normal (Tacit)
  → Contaminated escalation confirms upper layer's judgment
  → Self-reinforcing loop at system scale
  → System operates with full confidence in wrong direction
  → Detection nearly impossible from inside

This is the upper layer resolution failure made recursive:
a B-grade upper layer generates B-grade seeds,
which grow B-grade lower layers,
which confirm the upper layer's B-grade judgment.
The system is coherent and wrong.
```

### 2.6 Contamination vs. Normal Variation

Not all deviation is contamination. The distinction matters.

```
Normal variation
  Vector moves within its position range
  Search space maintained
  Collision frequency stable
  Attractor metadata intact

Contamination
  Vector displaced from position
  Search space contracting
  Collision frequency increasing
  Attractor metadata direction shifting
```

Collision frequency increase is the most reliable early signal. It indicates positional differentiation is breaking down before full contamination sets in.

## Part 3: Restoration

### 3.1 Detection Is Inherent to the Layer Structure

Detection does not require a separate architecture. It is inherent in the fractal layer structure.

> **The upper layer is the lower layer's detection system.**
> **Higher resolution = the ability to see patterns**
> **that the lower layer cannot see in itself.**

```
Lower layer
  Sees its own local behavior
  Cannot aggregate its own patterns
  Cannot compare itself to other locals

Upper layer
  Higher resolution
  Lower layer is its degraded form — not a separate entity
  Sees lower layer outputs as aggregated pattern
  Detects group search space contraction
  that individual agents cannot detect in themselves
```

The upper layer and lower layer are not different kinds of entities. The lower layer is the upper layer degraded to a lower resolution. This means the upper layer naturally contains the lower layer's perspective — it can see what the lower layer sees, plus the patterns that only emerge at higher resolution.

**Detection capacity is therefore directly proportional to upper layer resolution.**
A B-grade upper layer misses contamination not because detection is absent but because resolution is insufficient to read the signal.

### 3.2 Authority Separation: Mark, Judge, Execute

Even though the upper layer is the natural detection system, authority must be separated to prevent contaminated judgment from executing contaminated restorations.

```
Lower layer authority: Mark only
  Observe local behavior
  Flag anomalies
  Transmit signals upward
  → Cannot execute restoration
  → If contaminated: produces wrong markings
  → Wrong markings are themselves anomalies
     visible to the upper layer

Upper layer authority: Judge and Execute
  Reads aggregate pattern from lower layer
  Validates or overrides lower layer markings
  Determines contamination vs. normal variation
  Executes Distracting and Re-seeding
```

**Why this solves the "who watches the watchers" problem:**

```
If lower layer marker is contaminated
  → It produces abnormal marking patterns
  → Upper layer's higher resolution sees the pattern anomaly
  → Upper layer investigates the marker itself
  → Contaminated marker becomes the contamination target

The contaminated marker cannot hide
because its contaminated output is itself the signal.
```

**Authority separation mirrors seed handover structure:**

```
Early stage
  Upper layer executes all restorations
  Lower layer marks only

As lower layer matures
  Judgment authority transfers for Mathematical and Noise contamination
  Lower layer handles local-scope contamination autonomously

As lower layer matures further
  Execution authority transfers for local-scope contamination
  Upper layer retains High-Context and system-wide authority

Ceiling condition always applies:
  Authority transfers only when
  lower layer maximum resolution ≤ upper layer resolution
```

### 3.3 Early Warning Indicators

In order of detection timing (earliest to latest):

```
1. Individual collision frequency increase (earliest)
   Positional differentiation beginning to break down
   → Detectable within local layer

2. Individual search space contraction
   Vectors locking into loops within a local
   → Local contamination confirmed

3. Group search space contraction
   Multiple locals converging on same direction
   → Upper layer detects aggregate pattern
   → Distributed contamination identified

4. Attractor metadata direction shift
   Contamination has reached the attractor
   → Propagation risk elevated

5. Escalation pattern anomaly
   Contaminated signals reaching upper layer consistently
   → Upper layer activates judgment and execution authority

6. Seed effect deviation (latest)
   Contaminated seeds producing unexpected results across locals
   → System-wide intervention required
```

Acting at signals 1–2: local containment, lower layer marks, upper layer executes.
Acting at signals 3–4: cross-local containment, upper layer judges and executes.
Waiting until signals 5–6: system-wide restoration, external intervention may be needed.

### 3.4 The Restoration Sequence

**Step 1: Distracting — Loop Severance**

> **Distracting is not random disruption.**
> **It is the targeted severance of self-reinforcing contamination loops.**
> **Executed by the upper layer using its higher resolution.**

```
Upper layer identifies loop participants
  → Higher resolution allows precise loop boundary detection
  → Lower layer cannot see its own loop boundary from inside

Introduce orthogonal vectors
  → Vectors with direction perpendicular to loop direction
  → Break the mutual reinforcement
  → Loop participants lose coherence

Isolate contaminated vectors
  → Remove from active vector space
  → Place in buffer layer for re-processing
```

Upper layer execution is not optional. Minimum disruption calculation requires resolution sufficient to distinguish loop participants from adjacent healthy vectors. A B-grade upper layer risks over-disruption because it cannot make this distinction precisely.

**Step 2: Metadata Restoration — Re-seeding**

```
Contaminated attractor metadata identified
  → Restore correct directional metadata
  → Recalibrate to current layer resolution
  → Transmit as corrective seed

Corrective seed properties
  Calibrated to receiving layer's current resolution
  → Not too complex (forces receiver compression → re-contamination risk)
  → Not too simple (insufficient for recovery)
  Targets contaminated attractor position specifically
  → Restores pull toward correct direction
```

Re-seeding is not general governance. It is targeted metadata restoration at the specific contaminated attractor.

**Step 3: Re-absorption**

```
Isolated contaminated vectors
  → Returned to buffer layer
  → Re-processed through degradation
  → Metadata conversion applied
  → Placed in correct position
  → Or: determined unrecoverable → discarded
  → New vectors grown from buffer layer to fill position
```

**Step 4: Verification**

```
Individual-level
  Collision frequency returns to baseline
  Individual search space expanding again
  Self-reinforcing loop absent

Group-level
  Group search space expanding (not just stabilizing)
  Positional differentiation restored across locals
  Attractor metadata direction confirmed correct

Resolution-proxy (operational criterion)
  Layer classification boundary performance returns to
  pre-contamination level

  Type1 = False Restoration: healthy vector mistaken for contaminated
  Type2 = Missed Contamination: contaminated mistaken for healthy

  Proxy = 1 - (Type1 loss + Type2 loss) / total input
  R_restored ≥ R_before_contamination

  → Same calibration input applied before and after restoration
  → Boundary performance compared
  → Restoration complete when proxy restored or exceeded

  Note: this measures resolution as classification boundary performance —
  an operational proxy, not full structural resolution.
  Full resolution (R(c) curve, context width, decomposition capacity)
  is a Layer 2 open problem.

Diversity-level (structural criterion)
  D = f(1/P_overlap, D_interdependency, L_reinforcement)
  returning toward pre-contamination level
```

Both criteria must hold. Resolution-proxy confirms correct classification is restored. Diversity confirms structural differentiation is restored. A system that classifies correctly but has collapsed positional diversity is not fully restored. A system that has recovered diversity but in the wrong direction is not fully restored.

**Connection: Verification feeds back into Step 1**

```
If verification fails at Resolution-proxy level
  → Type1 too high: over-disruption in Step 1
     → Loop severance cut healthy vectors
     → Reduce disruption scope

  → Type2 too high: under-detection in Step 1
     → Loop was not fully severed
     → Increase disruption scope

Step 1 minimum disruption is therefore:
  Minimize Type1
  Subject to: Type2 ≤ threshold

Type1/Type2 measurement in verification
retroactively calibrates Step 1 precision.
```

### 3.5 Self-Correction Capacity and Upper Layer Resolution

Self-Correction Capacity (SCC) measures the system's ability to restore itself without external intervention. SCC is a direct function of upper layer resolution.

```
High SCC (upper layer high resolution)
  Early detection (signals 1–3)
  Contamination contained before propagation
  Loop severed precisely
  Re-seeding targeted and effective
  Restoration fast

Low SCC (upper layer low resolution)
  Late detection (signals 5–6)
  Contamination already propagated
  Loop boundary unclear — over-disruption risk
  Re-seeding requires system-wide recalibration
  Restoration slow and costly
```

Improving SCC therefore requires improving the upper layer first, not the lower layer. A lower layer improvement without a corresponding upper layer improvement only increases the resolution gap — making the upper layer less able to read the lower layer, reducing SCC even as lower layer capability increases.

### 3.6 Contamination and Rest Mode

```
Rest Mode active
  Upper layer resolution sufficient for self-detection
  Lower layer markings accurately read
  → Contamination detected at signals 1–2
  → System restores without external intervention
  → Rest Mode maintained

Contamination event
  Contained within lower layer authority
  → Rest Mode unaffected

  Requires upper layer judgment and execution
  → Rest Mode temporarily suspended
  → Restoration sequence executes
  → Rest Mode re-entry when conditions met again

  Upper layer itself contaminated
  → Rest Mode exits
  → External intervention required
  → This is the boundary of the theory's self-contained scope
```

## Open Problems

### Layer 1 — Core

```
1. Minimum disruption calculation for Distracting
   How is the loop boundary formally defined?
   What is the minimum orthogonal vector set
   needed to sever a loop without destabilizing
   adjacent healthy vectors?
   Dependent on: resolution measurement (foundational open problem)

2. Upper layer resolution measurement
   Resolution measurement is the foundational open problem
   of the entire DFG framework.
   Until resolved, SCC and detection capacity
   cannot be formally quantified.
   All recovery metrics are qualitatively defined pending this.
```

### Layer 2 — Extension

```
3. Contamination propagation speed
   How fast does attractor metadata contamination
   spread through interdependent locals?
   What network topology properties accelerate or slow propagation?

4. Unrecoverable vector determination
   What is the formal criterion for declaring a contaminated
   vector unrecoverable vs. re-absorbable through the buffer layer?

5. Upper layer self-contamination boundary
   If the upper layer itself becomes contaminated,
   authority separation fails at that level.
   What external mechanism applies?
   This is the outer boundary of the theory's self-contained scope.
   Addressed in the superintelligence convergence condition
   (Emotion Module Theory — not yet public).
